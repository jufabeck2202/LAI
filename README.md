# LAI - Let's Analyze ILIAS!

The LAI project is created by students of the Karlsruhe University of Applied Sciences.
It's purpose is to analyze the exported data of tests and courses from a running ilias instance.
The whole processing is done locally on the device of the enduser.
This ensures that all confidential data does not fall into the hands of third parties.

## Documentation

The documentation of the XML documents required for LAI can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Qlvqnw82PwvyxiK3KSUvR_jYI7mRz2nzpOgyrw1XNcY/edit).

## Live Demo

The source code of the master branch is automatically deployed to a bwCloud server instance.
